# Machine-Learning
This project involves analyzing a heart disease dataset from Kaggle and developing a predictive model. The steps include data preparation, analysis, and a diagnostic scenario for COVID-19.

1) Libraries Used:
a. Pandas: Data manipulation and analysis
b. NumPy: Numerical operations
c. Scikit-learn: Model training, testing, and evaluation
2) Data Preparation
a. Download the Dataset
- Source: Kaggle
b. Operations on Dataset
- Shape of data, missing values, data types, zeros in data, mean age
c. Data Extraction
- Columns: Age, Sex, ChestPain, RestBP, Chol
- Split: 75% training, 25% testing
3) Diagnostic Scenario
a. COVID-19 Prediction
b. Confusion matrix based on given data
c. Calculate Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score
